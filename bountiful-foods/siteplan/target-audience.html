        <p>One of the target audiences for Bountiful Foods are local individuals who prioritize their health and the environment, 
          and are willing to pay a premium for high-quality, organic food options. These individuals will most likely be in a
          higher pay bracket so as to afford this on a regular basis and will most likely be a customer of the store and not the
          food truck. A second target audience would be the tourist who is looking to treat themselves with a specialty drink or 
          fruit bag because they are on vacation and want to try the local specialties. A third target audience would be the individual 
          that is on the run needs something fresh, fast and healthy. This individual would most likely be purchasing the fruit or drink 
          out of the food truck where it is more conveniently located to their work or activity. The tourist would also be a likely patron
          of the food truck as it would be parked near tourist traps like the beach or other tourist activities.
