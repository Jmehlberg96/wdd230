      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the Green Valley Chamber of Commerce website is to support local businesses in many ways. The first way is through advertisement. As we 
        advertise our members businesses they will see and increase of traffic to their websites and storefronts which will increase sales and their profits. 
        Another way we support our local business is by sponsoring and advertising different events and attractions in our town that will boost tourism and traffic 
        to the local businesses. The third way we support members is by advocating on behalf of our businesses to the local and state government, protecting 
        business owners rights and helping to reduce government over-reach. In the Green Valley Chamber of Commerce, we work hard for our members and want them
        to succeed in our community. We believe that strong businesses create a stable financial community and result in a happier environment.
